# The remote Python debgger integration allows you to use the
# Visual Studio Code Python debug tooling with a remote
# Home Assistant instance.
#
# This integration is probably not useful to most of you,
# and I would not recommend on using it.
#
# For me it is helpful to debug issues on a production
# machine, while I develop on the Home Assistant project.
