# The sonos integration allows you to control your Sonos wireless speakers
# from Home Assistant. It also works with IKEA Symfonisk speakers.
#
# My Sonos lives in a different/vlan subnet. Because I don't want
# to fix this integration on my network to be capable of auto-discovery
# I have no choice but adding this host manually.
